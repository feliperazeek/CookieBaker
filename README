CookieBaker is a dead simple Java library to read and write cookies in POJO form to avoid string splits and joins all over your codebase. Behind the scenes CookieBaker stores the cookie in JSON format using Jackson.
CookieBaker also provides HMAC (http://www.cse.msu.edu/~alexliu/publications/Cookie/cookie.pdf) support off the shelve, currently using SHA1 by default. 

1) Define a simple POJO with a default constructor (required by Jackson)

public class SampleObject implements Serializable {

	private String myString;

	public SampleObject() {
	}
	
	public String getMyString() {
		return myString;
	}

	public void setMyString(String myString) {
		this.myString = myString;
	}
}

2) Set Cookie:

CookieBaker.saveCookie(response, cookieName, mySampleObjectInstance);

3) Get Cookie:

SampleObject o = CookieBaker.getCookie(request, SampleObject.class, cookieName);



Limitations:

- CookieBaker stores the cookie in JSON format using Jackson, be aware for the size of the cookie if the POJO has too many properties.
- POJO must have a default constructor which is a requirement of Jackson's ObjectMapper.



Roadmap:

- Find a way reduce the size of the cookie.
