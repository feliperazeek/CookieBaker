CookieBaker is a simple Java library to read and write cookies in POJO form to avoid string splits and joins all over your codebase. 
CookieBaker also provides HMAC support off-shelve, currently using SHA1 by default. 

1) Define a simple Pojo with a default constructor (required by Jackson)

public class SampleObject implements Serializable {

	private String myString;

	public SampleObject() {
	}
	
	public String getMyString() {
		return myString;
	}

	public void setMyString(String myString) {
		this.myString = myString;
	}
}

2) Set Cookie:

CookieBaker.saveCookie(response, cookieName, mySampleObjectInstance);

3) Get Cookie:

SampleObject o = CookieBaker.getCookie(request, SampleObject.class, cookieName);



Limitations:

- CookieBaker stores the cookie in JSON format using Jackson, be aware for the size of the cookie if the POJO has too many properties.
- POJO must have a default constructor which is a requirement of Jackson's ObjectMapper.
